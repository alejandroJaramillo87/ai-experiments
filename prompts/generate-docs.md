Here's a clear requirement document for your docs engineer:

# Documentation Standards: Linux Philosophy Style Requirements

## Overview
All markdown files in this repository must follow Linux philosophy principles: simple, modular, consistent, and purpose-driven documentation.

## Core Linux Philosophy Principles for Documentation

### 1. **Do One Thing Well**
- Each markdown file serves a single, clear purpose
- Avoid combining unrelated topics in one document
- File names clearly indicate the document's function
- Example: `installation.md`, `api-reference.md`, `troubleshooting.md`

### 2. **Keep It Simple and Clear**
- Use plain markdown syntax only
- Avoid excessive formatting (bold, italics only when necessary)
- Write in clear, direct language
- One concept per paragraph
- Short sentences preferred over long, complex ones

### 3. **Modular Organization**
- Documents reference each other rather than duplicating content
- Use relative links: `[Setup Guide](./setup.md)` not full URLs
- Create focused, reusable documentation components
- Separate concerns: installation ≠ configuration ≠ usage

### 4. **Consistent Structure**
Every markdown file must follow this template:
```markdown
# Document Title

Brief description of what this document covers.

## Section Headers Use ## 

### Subsections Use ###

#### Maximum 4 Levels ####

## Always End with References (if applicable)
- [Related Document](./path/to/doc.md)
- [External Resource](https://example.com)
```

## Formatting Requirements

### **File Structure**
```
# Single H1 title per file
## Major sections
### Subsections  
#### Detail level (maximum depth)
```

### **Content Style**
- **Headers:** Sentence case, no trailing punctuation
- **Lists:** Use `-` for unordered, `1.` for ordered
- **Code:** Use `backticks` for inline, ```language blocks for multi-line
- **Emphasis:** `**bold**` for important terms, `*italic*` sparingly
- **Links:** Descriptive text, not "click here"

### **File Naming Convention**
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `user-guide.md`
- Be descriptive: `api-authentication.md` not `auth.md`
- Group by purpose: `setup/`, `guides/`, `reference/`

## Content Philosophy

### **Be Practical**
- Focus on what users need to accomplish
- Include working examples
- Provide expected outputs
- Address common failure cases

### **Be Minimal**
- Include only necessary information
- Link to external resources rather than duplicating
- Remove redundant explanations
- Delete outdated content immediately

### **Be Consistent**
- Use the same terms throughout all documents
- Follow the same explanation patterns
- Maintain consistent code formatting
- Use the same file organization structure

## Quality Standards

### **Every Document Must Include:**
1. Clear purpose statement in first paragraph
2. Prerequisites (if any)
3. Step-by-step instructions where applicable
4. Expected results/outcomes
5. Links to related documentation

### **Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Single H1 title per file
- [ ] Clear purpose stated upfront
- [ ] Maximum 4 heading levels
- [ ] All links work and use relative paths
- [ ] Code examples are tested and functional
- [ ] No duplicate content between files
- [ ] File follows naming convention
- [ ] Content serves a single, clear purpose

## Examples

### **Good:**
```markdown
# API Authentication

This document explains how to authenticate with the project API.

## Prerequisites
- Valid API key from the dashboard
- curl or equivalent HTTP client

## Basic Authentication
Use your API key in the Authorization header:
```

### **Bad:**
```markdown
# API Stuff and Other Things!!!

This document covers authentication, rate limiting, error handling, 
and also some general tips about using our API effectively...

### Getting Started (Also Prerequisites)
You'll need several things...
```

## Implementation

### **Phase 1: Audit** (Week 1)
- Review all existing markdown files
- Identify non-compliant documents
- Create compliance checklist per file

### **Phase 2: Standardize** (Week 2-3)
- Rewrite non-compliant documents
- Implement consistent file naming
- Establish modular document structure

### **Phase 3: Maintain** (Ongoing)
- Review all new markdown files against these standards
- Update existing docs when modified
- Enforce standards in documentation reviews

## Success Metrics
- All markdown files pass validation checklist
- Documentation navigation is intuitive
- Users can find information in ≤ 2 clicks
- No duplicate content between files
- Documentation builds/renders without warnings
