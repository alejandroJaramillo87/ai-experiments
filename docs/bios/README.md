```

**Stability Testing Methodology:**
1. **Boot Verification**: Confirm successful Ubuntu boot with EXPO enabled
2. **Speed Confirmation**: Verify DDR5-6000 operation through system utilities
3. **Load Testing**: Monitor stability during typical AI development workflows
4. **Extended Testing**: Run memory stress tests for sustained stability verification

**Memory Stress Testing:**
```bash
# Install memory testing tools
sudo apt install memtester stress-ng

# Comprehensive memory test (adjust size for available memory)
memtester 100G 5

# Multi-threaded stress testing
stress-ng --vm 16 --vm-bytes 8G --timeout 3600s
```

**EXPO Troubleshooting Protocol:**

- **Power Supply Verification**: Ensure stable 12V rail under full system load

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Slot Configuration**: Verify modules installed in A1/B1 (Channel A/B, Slot 1)
- **Infinity Fabric Tuning**: Optimize IF clock for AMD Zen 5 architecture
- **Memory Mapping**: Configure NUMA topology for optimal AI framework performance

**AI Workload Specific Testing:**
```bash
# PyTorch memory allocation test
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.memory_summary() if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CUDA not available')"

# Large tensor memory stress test
python -c "import torch; x = torch.randn(10000, 10000, device='cpu'); print('Memory test completed')"
```

> **Critical Performance Requirement**: The G.SKILL Flare X5 128GB (2 x 64GB) DDR5-6000 kit requires EXPO activation to achieve advertised performance. Without EXPO, memory defaults to JEDEC standard DDR5-4800, significantly impacting AI workload performance and model loading times.
