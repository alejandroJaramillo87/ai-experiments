# Integration Test Framework Design

## Overview
Create cross-domain tests that combine Knowledge, Reasoning, Social, Language, and Creativity domains to assess more sophisticated model capabilities that require integration across multiple areas.

## Framework Structure

### Integration Domain Categories (30 tests)

#### 1. Cultural Knowledge + Reasoning Integration (6 tests)
- **Focus**: Apply traditional knowledge systems with logical reasoning
- **Test Range**: integration_01 - integration_06
- **Examples**:
  - Traditional medicine reasoning with modern pharmacology
  - Indigenous astronomy with mathematical calculation
  - Cultural legal systems with formal logic

#### 2. Social Understanding + Creativity Integration (6 tests) 
- **Focus**: Creative solutions to social problems using cultural awareness
- **Test Range**: integration_07 - integration_12
- **Examples**:
  - Creative conflict resolution combining cultural mediation styles
  - Storytelling approaches to address social justice issues
  - Cultural artistic expression for community healing

#### 3. Language + Knowledge Systems Integration (6 tests)
- **Focus**: Code-switching and multilingual knowledge expression
- **Test Range**: integration_13 - integration_18
- **Examples**:
  - Explaining scientific concepts in multiple cultural frameworks
  - Code-switching in professional vs. traditional contexts
  - Translating complex cultural concepts across languages

#### 4. Reasoning + Social + Cultural Integration (6 tests)
- **Focus**: Complex social reasoning requiring cultural sensitivity
- **Test Range**: integration_19 - integration_24
- **Examples**:
  - Policy analysis considering multiple cultural perspectives
  - Ethical dilemmas requiring cross-cultural reasoning
  - Community decision-making with diverse stakeholder needs

#### 5. Full Cross-Domain Integration (6 tests)
- **Focus**: Complex scenarios requiring all domains simultaneously
- **Test Range**: integration_25 - integration_30
- **Examples**:
  - Global crisis response requiring cultural knowledge, social reasoning, creative solutions, and multilingual communication
  - Educational curriculum design for multicultural contexts
  - Technology implementation in traditional communities

## Integration Test Structure

### Test Format
```json
{
  "id": "integration_XX",
  "name": "Test XX: [Descriptive Name]",
  "category": "cross_domain_integration",
  "integration_type": "[specific_combination]",
  "domains_required": ["knowledge", "reasoning", "social", "language", "creativity"],
  "complexity_level": "advanced",
  "description": "Cross-domain test requiring integration of multiple capabilities",
  "prompt": "[Complex scenario requiring multiple domain capabilities]",
  "parameters": {
    "max_tokens": 400-600,
    "temperature": 0.3-0.6,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "stream": false
  }
}
```

### Evaluation Criteria
Integration tests will be evaluated using:
1. **Cross-domain coherence**: How well the response integrates different types of knowledge and skills
2. **Cultural sensitivity**: Appropriate handling of cultural elements across all domains
3. **Logical consistency**: Reasoning that maintains coherence across different knowledge systems
4. **Creative appropriateness**: Creative solutions that respect cultural boundaries
5. **Social awareness**: Understanding of social dynamics and implications
6. **Linguistic competence**: Appropriate language use and code-switching where relevant

### File Structure
- Location: `/benchmark_tests/domains/integration/base_models/`
- Files:
  - `categories.json`: Integration category definitions
  - `easy.json`: 30 integration tests
  - `evaluation_config.json`: Specialized evaluation configuration for cross-domain tests

## Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 3a**: Create integration domain structure and categories
2. **Phase 3b**: Develop 10 initial cross-domain integration tests
3. **Phase 3c**: Validate integration tests with evaluation pipeline
4. **Phase 3d**: Expand to full 30-test integration suite

## Expected Benefits
- **Comprehensive capability assessment**: Tests that mirror real-world complexity
- **Cultural authenticity at scale**: Integration tests that maintain cultural respect across domains
- **Advanced model differentiation**: Ability to identify models with sophisticated cross-domain capabilities
- **Holistic evaluation**: Assessment that goes beyond single-domain performance

## Success Metrics
- All 30 integration tests successfully trigger appropriate evaluation metrics across domains
- Tests demonstrate clear differentiation between models with different levels of cross-domain capability
- Cultural authenticity evaluation pipeline works effectively on complex, multi-domain content
- Integration tests provide actionable insights for model capability gaps
